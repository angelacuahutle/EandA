        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
        Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
        environment to provide programmatic control over them.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
        elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of
        purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="what_you_should_already_know">
      <header>What you should already know</header>
      <nav id="navbar">
        <header>What you should already know</header>
        <a href="#what_you_should_already_know" class="nav-link">What you should already know</a>
      </nav>

        This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="javascript_and_java">
      <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
      <nav id="navbar">
        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <a href="#javascript_and_java" class="nav-link">JavaScript and Java</a>
      </nav>
      <ul>
        <li>Element 1</li>
        <li>Element 2</li>
        <li>Element 3</li>
        <li>Element 4</li>
        <li>Element 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language
        resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java
        expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
        from LiveScript to JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system
        based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a
        prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
        provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
        supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects,
        executing as loosely typed methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and
        methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not
        have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
      </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
      <header>Hello world</header>
      <nav id="navbar">
        <header>Hello world</header>
        <a href="#hello_world" class="nav-link">Hello world</a>
      </nav>
      <ul>
        <li>Element 1</li>
        <li>Element 2</li>
        <li>Element 3</li>
        <li>Element 4</li>
        <li>Element 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
      </p>
      <code>
        function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
         greetMe("World");
      </code>
      <p>
        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <nav id="navbar">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <a href="#variables" class="nav-link">Variables</a>
      </nav>
      <p>
        You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers,
        conform to certain rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can
        also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z"
        (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape
        sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

    <section class="main-section" id="declaring_variables">
      <header>Declaring Variables</header>
      <nav id="navbar">
        <header>Declaring Variables</header>
        <a href="#declaring_variables" class="nav-link">Declaring Variables</a>
      </nav>
      <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
      <p>
        With the keyword var. For example,
      </p>
      <code>
        var x = 42.
      </code>
      <p>
        This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        By simply assigning it a value. For example,
      </p>
      <code>
        x = 42.
      </code>
      <p>
        This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
        variant.

        With the keyword let. For example,
      </p>
      <code>
        let y = 13.
      </code>
      <p>
        This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
      <header>Variable Scope</header>
      <nav id="navbar">
        <header>Variable Scope</header>
        <a href="#variable_scope" class="nav-link">Variable Scope</a>
      </nav>
      <p>
        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to
        any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local
        variable, because it is available only within that function.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a
        block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code
        will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
        block, which in this case is an if statement.
      </p>
      <code>
        if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
      </code>
